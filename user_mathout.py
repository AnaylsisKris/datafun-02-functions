Task 3 Questions
     4. How many arguments does get_area_of_lot() take? 2
     5. What does it return? I've assigned it to return area that I determined is length * width

=============================================================

1.Use the defensive math examples to call the permutations and combinations as shown.

math.comb(5,1) = 5
math.perm(5,1) = 5

2.Then, call the method you just fixed with several different arguments and display them for the user.

     The custom function, get_area_of_lot(3,2), returns 15
     The custom function, get_area_of_lot(10,2), returns 20
     The custom function, get_area_of_lot(8,7), returns 56

 How many arguments are needed? 2
 Call get_area_of_lot(6, 2) and display the result.
     The custom function, get_area_of_lot(6,2), returns 12 .


3. Can you write and call custom functions with examples? see below
4. Add three more simple functions that might be useful to your domain. see below
=============================================================


A common way to calculate Pythagorean Winning Percentage (W%) for pitchers is using the formula
W%=[(Runs Scored)^1.81]/[(Runs Scored)^1.81 + (Runs Allowed)^1.81] x 100
Miles Mikolas had 81 runs scored and 74 runs allowed in 2022.
         per this equation, his W% was 56.5.

Another useful statistic for pitchers is Win-Loss Percentages.
Mile Mikolas won 12 and lost 13 of the games he pitched in 2022
That gave him a W-L% of 48.0

The percent difference of the two pitching statitics is 0.08 %
